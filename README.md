# LP4-Machine-Learning-Web-Apps-Using-Streamlit-and-Gradio
Model deployment forms part of the CRISP-DM framework and its importance cannot be overlooked. Model Deployment is the method by which you integrate a machine learning model into an existing production environment to make practical business decisions based on data. 

To get the most value out of machine learning models, it is important to seamlessly deploy them into production so a business can start using them to make practical decisions.

### Objectives of this project
Building customizable Graphic User Interface components with Streamlit and Gradio.
Deploying Machine Learning models to Streamlit App for real-time prediction.
Deploying Machine Learning models to Gradio App for real-time prediction.
